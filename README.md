# bulk_mediafile_manager
Manages audio and video files for language data, for example WAVs, video files, etc, allowing the user an easy to bulk copy, convert, and rename (like with prefixes and suffixes). Useful for working with the results of the Video Annotation Tool or with Dekrereke audio files.


This is still very much a work in process.
